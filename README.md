5.Feedback Loop: Continuous improvement through user feedback, enhancing recommendation effectiveness over time.

Blockchain Workflow:

Overview: This project focuses on the deployment of a Polygon Edge Chain on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The Polygon Edge Chain provides high-performance, low-latency infrastructure for blockchain applications. By successfully running a Polygon Edge Chain, this project aims to facilitate the development of efficient and scalable decentralized applications

Consortium blockchain architecture: Node Each node stores a copy of the blockchain and participates in the consensus process to validate transactions and add new blocks to the chain. There are two nodes running on the polygon blockchain

Ledger The ledger is the decentralized database that stores all of the transactions that occur on the blockchain

Smart Contracts Smart contracts are self-executing contracts. These are used in blockchain consortium architecture to automate the process of executing transactions on the blockchain. The smart Contract Management component simplifies Ethereum transaction submission and application development by providing clean RESTful interfaces for interaction with your smart contract methods.
Governance Consortium blockchain governance is member-defined and adaptable, comprising rules and decision-making mechanisms tailored to specific use cases and goals. Access to a private blockchain network is restricted to authorized parties only, and the network is not open to the public. Private blockchains are preferred in enterprise use cases, such as supply chain management, to maintain greater network control.
